# Aspen-Plus---Matlab-Link
This file outline the Aspen Plus and Matlab connection through COM Technology.

Simulation of chemical process is essential to develop sustainable designs. Nowadays, with the competitiveness in the markets, it demands the optimal operation of any chemical plant. In the new designs of chemical processes, design optimization is mandatory.

Matlab is a program widely used and accepted by the academic community. Academics daily load codes with advanced numerical methods of great application for engineering. Advanced optimization methods must be taken into account to apply them in the optimal design of chemical processes. Therefore, the connection between chemical process simulation programs (Aspen Plus, Hysys, Pro II, etc.) and tools such as Matlab are very useful.

Also, several people have written me to the email requesting an example. See post in ResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_I_integrate_Aspen_Plus_and_Matlab_for_optimization_propose

I present an example of connection between Aspen Plus V.10.0 and Matlab. The simulation corresponds to a reactive distillation column. As an application of the connection, a sensitivity analysis is done using Matlab (for loop).

Its only necessary to place the two files in a folder and run the AspenPlus_Matlab.m
